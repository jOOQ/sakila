# The Sakila example database

The Sakila database is a nicely normalised database modelling a DVD
rental store (for those of you old enough to remember what that
is). Its design includes a few nice features:

- Many to many relationships
- Multiple paths between entities (e.g. film-inventory-rental-payment
  vs film-inventory-store-customer-payment) to practice joins
- Consistent naming of columns
  - Primary keys are called `[tablename]_[id]`
  - Foreign keys are called like their referenced primary key, if
    possible. This allows for using `JOIN .. USING` syntax where
    supported
  - Relationship tables do not have any surrogate keys but use composite primary keys
  - Every table has a `last_update` audit column
  - A generated data set of a reasonable size is available

## Engineering
### Persisting data to the DBMS
#### Prerequisites
- make
- bash
- target DBMS server
- target DBMS client

One needs to persist the Sakila data to the DBMS to be able to play
with it. The target DBMS client should be pointing to the target DBMS
server

#### PostgreSQL
Please switch to the postgres directory
``` bash
cd postgres-sakila-db
```
##### Creating the Schema
``` bash
make build
```

##### Inserting the Data
``` bash
make install
```

##### Deleting the Data
``` bash
make uninstall
```

##### Destroying the Schema
``` bash
make clean
```

### ERD

With this database, we can try out some nice SQL queries, e.g. by using PostgreSQL syntax:

**Actor with most films (ignoring ties)**

```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name, count(*) films
FROM actor AS a
JOIN film_actor AS fa USING (actor_id)
GROUP BY actor_id, first_name, last_name
ORDER BY films DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

Yields:

```
first_name    last_name    films
--------------------------------
GINA          DEGENERES       42
```

**Cumulative revenue of all stores**

```sql
SELECT payment_date, amount, sum(amount) OVER (ORDER BY payment_date)
FROM (
  SELECT CAST(payment_date AS DATE) AS payment_date, SUM(amount) AS amount
  FROM payment
  GROUP BY CAST(payment_date AS DATE)
) p
ORDER BY payment_date;
```

Yields:

```
payment_date       amount         sum
